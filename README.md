# ISE-Bug-Report-Classification-Tool-Building-Project

**In this GitHub Repository, we have the following files and folder:**

- **requirements.pdf** : States the dependencies/versions that are required to compile and run the code
- **manual.pdf** : Provides instructions on how to use our proposed solution tool and the baseline solution tool
- **replication.pdf** : Provides instructions on how to replicate the results stated in the report
- **bug_report_tool_ise_coursework** : This folder contains the proposed solution tool, baseline solution tool, raw results (.csv files)   and datasets (.csv files)
